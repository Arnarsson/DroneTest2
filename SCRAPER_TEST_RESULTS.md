- 🇸🇪 Sweden: 0 incidents
- 🇫🇮 Finland: 0 incidents

## Multi-Source Consolidation Test

### Scenario: Munich Airport
If multiple sources report the same Munich incident, consolidation should merge them.

**Current**: 1 source (Deutsche Welle)
**Expected**: Additional sources may pick this up
**Test**: Monitor for consolidation when 2+ sources report same incident

### Scenario: Denmark Incidents
DW article mentions "Denmark and Norway closed airports last week"
**Current**: We have 5 Danish police Twitter incidents
**Expected**: These may be the SAME incidents mentioned by DW
**Test**: Consolidation should NOT duplicate if locations/times match

---

## Keyword Effectiveness

### High-Performance Keywords
- ✅ "drone" + "airport" = Excellent (Munich Airport found)
- ✅ "drone" + "airspace" = Good (Poland incursion found)
- ✅ "drone" + "sighting" = Good (multiple mentions)

### Low-Performance Keywords
- ⚠️ "uav" = Rare in news articles
- ⚠️ "unmanned" = Rare in news articles

**Recommendation**: Keep current keyword lists - they're working well.

---

## Evidence Score Predictions

### Munich Airport Incident
**Current**: 2 (REPORTED - single media source)
**If official source found**: Upgrade to 4 (OFFICIAL)
**If 2+ media sources**: Upgrade to 3 (VERIFIED)

### Poland Airspace Incident
**Current**: 3 (VERIFIED - major news source Der Spiegel)
**If official source found**: Upgrade to 4 (OFFICIAL)
**If 2+ media sources**: Stays 3 (VERIFIED)
