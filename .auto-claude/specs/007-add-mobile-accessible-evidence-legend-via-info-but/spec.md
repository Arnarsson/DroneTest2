# Add mobile-accessible Evidence Legend via info button in header

## Overview

The EvidenceLegend component is hidden on mobile devices (uses 'hidden lg:block' class), leaving mobile users without access to understand evidence scoring levels when viewing the map.

## Rationale

Mobile users make up a significant portion of web traffic and should have equal access to understand the evidence scoring system. Currently they have no way to learn what the colored markers mean without accessing the About page.
