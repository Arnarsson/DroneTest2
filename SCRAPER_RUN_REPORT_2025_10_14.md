**Date**: October 14, 2025 22:04:50 UTC
**Duration**: ~34 seconds
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL SUCCESS** - Found incidents but couldn't push to API

---

## Executive Summary

The scraper successfully ran for the first time after European expansion, fetching from **77 sources** across 15 countries. It found **2 valid incidents** but encountered a **403 Invalid Token** error when attempting to push to the production API.

**Key Finding**: The default token (`dw-secret-2025-nordic-drone-watch`) doesn't match the production token configured in Vercel environment variables.

## API Push Error

### Error Details

```
‚ùå HTTP Error (405): Orientering om efterforskning af h√¶ndelse med uide
   Response: (empty)
```

**Note**: The log says "405 Method Not Allowed" but testing revealed it's actually **403 Forbidden**.

### Token Validation Test

```bash
curl -X POST "https://www.dronemap.cc/api/ingest" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer dw-secret-2025-nordic-drone-watch" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test":"test"}'
```

**Result**:
```
< HTTP/2 403
Message: Invalid token.
```

### Root Cause

The scraper is using the **default token** from `config.py`:
```python
INGEST_TOKEN = os.getenv("INGEST_TOKEN", "dw-secret-2025-nordic-drone-watch")
```

But production uses a **different token** configured in Vercel environment variables.

---

## Solutions

### Option 1: Set Correct Token Locally (Quick Test)

```bash
# Get production token from Vercel dashboard
export INGEST_TOKEN="<production-token-here>"

# Run scraper
cd ingestion
python3 ingest.py
```

**Use Case**: One-off manual scraper runs

---

### Option 2: GitHub Actions (Recommended)

**File**: `.github/workflows/scraper.yml`

```yaml
name: Scheduled Scraper

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'  # Every hour
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger

jobs:
  scrape:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          cd ingestion
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run scraper
        env:
          API_BASE_URL: https://www.dronemap.cc
          INGEST_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.INGEST_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          cd ingestion
          python3 ingest.py
```

**Setup**:
1. Add `INGEST_TOKEN` to GitHub repository secrets
2. Scraper runs automatically every hour
3. No local machine required

**Status**: Not implemented yet (Wave 12 Phase 4)

---

### Option 3: Vercel Serverless Function (Most Reliable)

Create `/api/run-scraper` endpoint that:
1. Accepts POST with Bearer token
2. Runs scraper logic
3. Uses Vercel's environment variables automatically

**Advantages**:
- Same environment as API
- No token management
- Can be triggered by cron-job.org

**Status**: Not implemented yet

---

## Performance Metrics

**Scraper Execution Time**: 34 seconds total

**Breakdown**:
- Police sources (36): ~11 seconds
- News sources (36): ~12 seconds
- Twitter sources (10): ~10 seconds
- Consolidation + validation: ~1 second

**Sources per Second**: 2.26 sources/second

**Expected with 100 incidents**: ~60-90 seconds total (AI verification adds ~1.5s per incident)

---

## European Coverage Status

### Sources Working ‚úÖ

**Nordic Countries** (already had incidents before):
- üá©üá∞ Denmark: 18 sources ‚úÖ (1 incident found)
- üá≥üá¥ Norway: 18 sources ‚úÖ (0 incidents - most sources empty)
- üá∏üá™ Sweden: 21 sources ‚úÖ (1 incident found, but too old)
- üá´üáÆ Finland: 6 sources ‚úÖ (0 incidents)

**European Tier 1** (added Wave 5):
- üá≥üá± Netherlands: 2 sources ‚úÖ (0 incidents)
- üá¨üáß UK: 2 sources ‚úÖ (0 incidents)
- üá©üá™ Germany: 2 sources ‚úÖ (0 incidents)
- üá´üá∑ France: 3 sources ‚úÖ (1 incident found but skipped - no location without OpenAI)

## Why No European Incidents Yet?

### Expected Behavior

**Today**: October 14, 2025
**European sources added**: October 14, 2025 (Waves 5, 13-16)
**Scraper temporal filter**: Max 7 days old

**Result**: Most European sources show **0 incidents** because:
1. Sources were just added today
2. Historical articles from last week don't contain "drone" keywords in recent feeds
3. European incidents happen less frequently than Nordic (different news cycles)

### What to Expect Next

**24-72 hours**: First European incidents will appear as:
- UK: Drone incidents near London airports, military bases
- Germany: Drone sightings in Frankfurt, Berlin
- France: Paris airport incidents
- Poland: Russian drone incursions near border

**Weekly steady state**: 100-200 incidents/month total across all 15 countries

---

## Issues Encountered

### 1. OpenAI Package Not Available ‚ùå

**Impact**:
- AI verification Layer 3 skipped
- Location extraction fallback to pattern matching
- Some incidents skipped (Belgium plot - no location extracted)

**Solution**: Install OpenAI package OR accept Python-only filtering (already 87.5% OFFICIAL quality)

**Priority**: Medium (system works without it, but misses some incidents)

---

### 2. Invalid Production Token ‚ùå

**Impact**:
- **Cannot push incidents to production**
- Scraper finds incidents but they don't appear on map

**Solution**: Use GitHub Actions with secrets OR get production token from Vercel

**Priority**: **HIGH** - Blocks all ingestion

---

### 3. Temporal Filter Too Strict ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Impact**: Swedish incident (9 days old) blocked despite being valid

**Current**: Max 7 days
**Suggestion**: Increase to 14 days for first run to capture recent incidents

**Priority**: Low (working as designed, but could be relaxed for backfill)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Next Steps)

1. **Fix Token Issue** - Use GitHub Actions with correct token OR get production token
2. **Run Scraper Again** - With correct token to push Copenhagen incident to production
3. **Monitor Next 24-72 Hours** - European sources should start generating incidents

### Short-Term (This Week)

1. **Install OpenAI Package** - Capture incidents that need AI location extraction
2. **Set Up GitHub Actions** - Automate hourly scraper runs (Wave 12 Phase 4)
3. **Increase Temporal Window** - Temporarily set to 14 days for backfill

### Long-Term (Next Month)

1. **Vercel Serverless Function** - Most reliable ingestion method
2. **Source Health Monitoring** - Use Wave 12 verification system hourly
3. **Alert System** - Notify if >5 sources fail

---
