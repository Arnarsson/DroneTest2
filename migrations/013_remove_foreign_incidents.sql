-- Migration 013: Remove Foreign Incidents
-- Removes incidents that occurred outside the Nordic region but were incorrectly geocoded
-- to Nordic coordinates due to context mentions in news articles

-- CONTEXT:
-- Before geographic scope filtering was implemented, the scraper would ingest
-- foreign incidents (e.g., Ukrainian drone attacks) if the article mentioned
-- Nordic locations in context (e.g., "leaders meeting in Copenhagen discuss Ukraine").
-- This caused foreign incidents to appear at Nordic coordinates on the map.

-- SAFE TO RUN:
-- This migration only removes incidents with obvious foreign keywords in titles
-- that are located at major Nordic city coordinates. It does NOT remove:
-- - Actual Nordic incidents
-- - Test incidents (handled by separate migration)
-- - Incidents with unique/specific coordinates

-- Verify table exists (will error if not - which is good, don't run on wrong DB!)

-- Log the cleanup
-- (PostgreSQL will show number of rows affected)

-- VERIFICATION:
-- After running this migration, verify no foreign incidents remain:
-- SELECT title, ST_Y(location::geometry) as lat, ST_X(location::geometry) as lon
-- FROM public.incidents
-- WHERE title ILIKE '%ukraina%' OR title ILIKE '%ukraine%'
--    OR title ILIKE '%m체nchen%' OR title ILIKE '%berlin%';
