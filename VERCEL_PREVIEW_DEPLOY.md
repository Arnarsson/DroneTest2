## Browser Testing Checklist

### 1. Evidence Legend Testing

- [ ] Chevron indicator (‚Üí) visible
- [ ] Click card ‚Üí navigates to incident detail
- [ ] Close button (X) works
- [ ] Outside click closes modal

### 4. Filter Testing

## Consolidation Testing (After GitHub Actions Deployed)

Once hourly ingestion is running, test consolidation with new incidents:

### Scenario 1: Same Location + Time ‚Üí MERGE
**Setup**: Wait for scraper to find duplicate incidents
**Expected**:
- 2 news sources report same incident
- Consolidation merges them
- Popup shows 2 sources
- Evidence score upgrades if applicable

### Scenario 2: Different Locations ‚Üí SEPARATE
**Setup**: Incidents at different airports
**Expected**:
- 2 separate markers on map
- Each has own popup
- Legend counts update correctly

### Scenario 3: Evidence Score Upgrade
**Setup**: Media source + Police source for same incident
**Expected**:
- Evidence score upgrades from 2 (REPORTED) ‚Üí 4 (OFFICIAL)
- Legend counts shift: REPORTED -1, OFFICIAL +1
- Badge color changes Orange ‚Üí Green

## Performance Testing

### Load Time Targets
- [ ] **Initial page load**: < 3s on 3G
- [ ] **API response**: < 500ms
- [ ] **Map render**: < 1s
- [ ] **Filter update**: < 200ms

### Bundle Size Check
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build

# Check output:
# ‚úì Route (app)                              ~147 kB
# ‚úì /_not-found                              867 B
# + First Load JS shared by all              167 kB
```

**Targets**:
- Initial bundle: < 200 KB ‚úÖ (currently 167 KB)
- Route bundle: < 150 KB ‚úÖ (currently 147 KB)

## Known Issues to Watch For

### Issue 1: date-fns Import Error
**Symptom**: Build fails with "barrel loader" error
**Cause**: Incorrect date-fns imports
**Fix**: All imports use specific paths (e.g., `'date-fns/format'`)
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED in this branch

### Issue 2: PostGIS Query Timeout
**Symptom**: API returns empty array or timeout error
**Cause**: Supabase pooler connection issue
**Fix**: Already using port 6543 (transaction pooler)
**Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING (verified in production)

### Issue 3: Legend Counts Mismatch
**Symptom**: Legend shows 0 for all levels
**Cause**: `incidents` prop not passed
**Fix**: Added `incidents={incidents || []}` in page.tsx
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED in this branch

## Rollback Plan

If preview testing reveals critical issues:

### Option 1: Quick Fix
```bash
# Make fix in feature branch
git add .
git commit -m "fix: [issue description]"
git push origin feature/senior-ux-redesign

# Vercel auto-redeploys preview
```

### Option 2: Rollback to Main
```bash
# Don't merge feature branch yet
# Production stays on main branch (working)
# Continue fixing in feature branch
```
