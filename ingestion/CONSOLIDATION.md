# Incident Consolidation Engine

## Overview

The consolidation engine merges multiple sources reporting the same drone incident into a single, authoritative record with upgraded evidence scores.

**Architecture**: "1 incident = multiple sources"

## Problem Solved

Before consolidation:
```
Map shows:
- Copenhagen Airport: 3 markers (BT, DR, Police)
- Aalborg Airport: 2 markers (Nordjyske, TV2)
```

After consolidation:
```
Map shows:
- Copenhagen Airport: 1 marker (3 sources, evidence score 4 - OFFICIAL)
- Aalborg Airport: 1 marker (2 sources, evidence score 3 - VERIFIED)
```

## Key Features

### 1. Space-Time Grouping

Incidents are grouped by:
- **Location**: Rounded to 0.01° (~1.1km radius)
- **Time**: Bucketed into 6-hour windows
- **Asset Type**: airport, military, harbor, etc.
- **Country**: Prevents cross-border merging

**Example**:
```
lat 55.618, lon 12.648, time 2025-10-14T20:30, asset_type airport, country DK
→ Hash: "55.62_12.65_2025-10-14T18:00_airport_DK"

lat 55.619, lon 12.649, time 2025-10-14T21:15, asset_type airport, country DK
→ Hash: "55.62_12.65_2025-10-14T18:00_airport_DK"  # SAME → Will merge
```

### 2. Source Deduplication

- Deduplicates sources by URL (prevents double-counting same article)
- Keeps ALL unique sources (no filtering by type)
- Tracks `source_count` and `merged_from` metadata

### 3. Authority Ranking

Sources are sorted by trust_weight (4 → 3 → 2 → 1):
- **4**: Official (police, military, NOTAM, aviation authority)
- **3**: Verified media (major news outlets)
- **2**: Credible media (local news, specialized outlets)
- **1**: Social media, unverified sources

### 4. Evidence Score Recalculation

Rules (from `constants/evidence.ts`):
- **ANY** trust_weight 4 source → score 4 (OFFICIAL)
- **2+** trust_weight ≥2 sources → score 3 (VERIFIED - multi-source)
- **Single** trust_weight ≥2 → score 2 (REPORTED)
- **Low trust** → score 1 (UNCONFIRMED)

**Example Upgrades**:
```
[BT (trust_weight: 2)] → score 2
[BT (2), DR (2)] → score 3 (upgraded!)
[BT (2), Police (4)] → score 4 (upgraded!)
```

### 5. Data Merging Strategy

- **Title**: Longest with substance (most descriptive)
- **Narrative**: Longest (most detailed reporting)
- **Sources**: All unique sources, ranked by authority
- **Metadata**: Tracks `merged_from` count, `source_count`

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from consolidator import ConsolidationEngine

engine = ConsolidationEngine(
    location_precision=0.01,  # ~1km (0.01° ≈ 1.1km at Nordic latitudes)
    time_window_hours=6       # Groups incidents within 6-hour windows
)

# Consolidate incidents
consolidated = engine.consolidate_incidents(raw_incidents)
```

### Get Statistics

```python
stats = engine.get_consolidation_stats(incidents)
print(f"Total incidents: {stats['total_incidents']}")
print(f"Unique locations: {stats['unique_hashes']}")
print(f"Multi-source groups: {stats['multi_source_groups']}")
print(f"Potential merges: {stats['potential_merges']}")
print(f"Merge rate: {stats['merge_rate']:.1f}%")
```

## Integration with Ingestion Pipeline

The consolidation engine is integrated into `ingest.py` at **Step 5** (after non-incident filtering, before sending to API):

```python
# 5. Consolidate incidents (merge multiple sources)
from consolidator import ConsolidationEngine

consolidation_engine = ConsolidationEngine(
    location_precision=0.01,
    time_window_hours=6
)

# Get statistics
stats = consolidation_engine.get_consolidation_stats(all_incidents)
print(f"Before consolidation: {stats['total_incidents']} incidents")
print(f"Multi-source groups: {stats['multi_source_groups']}")

# Consolidate
all_incidents = consolidation_engine.consolidate_incidents(all_incidents)
print(f"After consolidation: {len(all_incidents)} incidents")
```

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
cd ingestion
python3 test_consolidator.py
```

**Test Coverage**:
1. Single incident → No consolidation
2. Same location + time → MERGE
3. Different locations → NO MERGE
4. Evidence upgrade: media (2) + police (4) → OFFICIAL (4)
5. Source deduplication by URL
6. Authority ranking verification
7. Consolidation statistics

**Expected Result**: 7/7 tests passing

### Run Integration Test

```bash
python3 test_integration_simple.py
```

**Simulates**:
- 6 incidents from scrapers
- 3 locations (Copenhagen, Aalborg, Billund)
- Multi-source merging
- Evidence score upgrades

**Expected Result**: Integration test passed

## Architecture Details

### Incident Data Structure

**Input** (from scrapers):
```python
{
    'title': 'Drone spotted at airport',
    'lat': 55.618,
    'lon': 12.648,
    'occurred_at': '2025-10-14T14:30:00+00:00',
    'asset_type': 'airport',
    'country': 'DK',
    'narrative': 'Full article text...',
    'evidence_score': 2,
    'sources': [{
        'source_url': 'https://bt.dk/article1',
        'source_name': 'BT',
        'source_type': 'news',
        'trust_weight': 2
    }]
}
```

**Output** (after consolidation):
```python
{
    'title': 'Police investigating drone incident at airport',  # Best title
    'lat': 55.618,
    'lon': 12.648,
    'occurred_at': '2025-10-14T14:30:00+00:00',
    'asset_type': 'airport',
    'country': 'DK',
    'narrative': 'Most detailed article text...',  # Longest narrative
    'evidence_score': 4,  # Upgraded from 2 to 4
    'merged_from': 3,  # Metadata: merged from 3 incidents
    'source_count': 3,  # Metadata: 3 unique sources
    'sources': [
        {'source_url': 'https://politi.dk/stmt', 'source_name': 'Police', 'trust_weight': 4},
        {'source_url': 'https://dr.dk/article2', 'source_name': 'DR', 'trust_weight': 2},
        {'source_url': 'https://bt.dk/article1', 'source_name': 'BT', 'trust_weight': 2}
    ]
}
```

### Spacetime Key Generation

```python
def generate_spacetime_key(incident: Dict) -> str:
    # Round coordinates to 0.01° precision
    lat_rounded = round(incident['lat'] / 0.01) * 0.01
    lon_rounded = round(incident['lon'] / 0.01) * 0.01

    # Round time to 6-hour window (00:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00)
    occurred_at = datetime.fromisoformat(incident['occurred_at'])
    time_bucket = occurred_at.replace(
        hour=(occurred_at.hour // 6) * 6,
        minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0
    )

    # Include country to prevent cross-border merging
    key = f"{lat_rounded:.2f}_{lon_rounded:.2f}_{time_bucket.isoformat()}_{asset_type}_{country}"
    return key
```

### Evidence Score Logic

```python
def recalculate_evidence_score(sources: List[Dict]) -> int:
    if not sources:
        return 1

    max_trust = max([s.get('trust_weight', 1) for s in sources])

    # Tier 4: ANY official source
    if max_trust >= 4:
        return 4

    # Tier 3: Multiple credible sources (trust_weight ≥ 2)
    credible_sources = [s for s in sources if s.get('trust_weight', 0) >= 2]
    if len(credible_sources) >= 2:
        return 3  # Multi-source verification upgrade

    # Tier 2: Single credible source
    if max_trust >= 2:
        return 2

    # Tier 1: Low trust sources only
    return 1
```

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage

- **O(n)** space complexity (stores incidents in hash map)
- Typical usage: 100-200 incidents/month → negligible memory

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)** for grouping incidents by spacetime key
- **O(m log m)** for sorting sources within each group (m = sources per group, typically 2-5)
- **Overall: O(n log m)** where n = incidents, m = sources per incident

### Scalability

Current implementation handles:
- **1000+ incidents**: <100ms processing time
- **10,000+ incidents**: <1s processing time

No optimization needed for current scale (100-200 incidents/month).

## Edge Cases

### 1. Cross-Border Incidents

**Problem**: Copenhagen Airport (Denmark) and Malmö (Sweden) are ~25km apart. Without country filtering, incidents might merge incorrectly.

**Solution**: Include `country` in spacetime key to prevent cross-border merging.

### 2. Time Window Boundaries

**Problem**: Incident at 17:59 and 18:01 might be split into different 6-hour windows.

**Solution**: Acceptable trade-off. Articles published minutes apart about the same event typically share more metadata (location, title similarity) that consolidation can use.

### 3. Source Deduplication

**Problem**: Same article URL appears in multiple "incidents" (shouldn't happen, but possible).

**Solution**: Deduplicate sources by URL before merging.

### 4. Title Selection

**Problem**: Generic title ("Drone spotted") vs descriptive title ("Police investigating unauthorized UAV at Copenhagen Airport").

**Solution**: Select longest title with most words (more descriptive usually).

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Fuzzy Location Matching

Current: Hard 0.01° precision
Future: Adaptive precision based on location density (tighter in cities, looser in rural areas)

### 2. Semantic Title Matching

Current: Longest title wins
Future: Use AI to select most informative title based on content, not length

### 3. Temporal Clustering

Current: Fixed 6-hour windows
Future: Dynamic windows based on event type (breaking news: 1-hour window, routine patrol: 12-hour window)

### 4. Cross-Reference Detection

Current: Merge only by location + time
Future: Detect when articles explicitly reference each other ("as reported by BT earlier...")

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Too Many Merges

**Symptom**: Unrelated incidents merged together

**Diagnosis**:
```python
stats = engine.get_consolidation_stats(incidents)
print(f"Merge rate: {stats['merge_rate']:.1f}%")  # Should be 20-50%
```

**Solutions**:
- Reduce `location_precision` (e.g., 0.01 → 0.005 for tighter grouping)
- Reduce `time_window_hours` (e.g., 6 → 3 for stricter time matching)

### Issue: Too Few Merges

**Symptom**: Same incident appears multiple times on map

**Diagnosis**:
```python
stats = engine.get_consolidation_stats(incidents)
print(f"Multi-source groups: {stats['multi_source_groups']}")  # Should be >0
```

**Solutions**:
- Increase `location_precision` (e.g., 0.01 → 0.02 for looser grouping)
- Increase `time_window_hours` (e.g., 6 → 12 for wider time matching)

### Issue: Evidence Score Not Upgrading

**Symptom**: Merged incident still has low evidence score despite official sources

**Diagnosis**:
```python
for source in incident['sources']:
    print(f"{source['source_name']}: trust_weight={source['trust_weight']}")
```

**Solutions**:
- Verify `trust_weight` is set correctly in scrapers
- Check `recalculate_evidence_score()` logic in `consolidator.py`
