## Technical Implementation

### Changes Made

1. **config.py** (lines 787-888):
   - Added 7 new source entries with complete metadata
   - All sources verified with HTTP requests (curl testing)
   - Keywords include English + native language terms (Spanish, Italian, Polish, German)
   - Geographic coverage documented (country codes: BE, ES, IT, PL, AT, CH)

2. **Header Documentation** (lines 20-35):
   - Updated total source count: 74 RSS feeds + 3 HTML scrapers = 77 total
   - Documented Waves 13-16 additions by country

### Verification Status

All 7 sources tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ Belgium: 1/1 (HTTP 200, Content-Type: text/html)
- ✅ Spain: 1/1 (HTTP 200, Content-Type: text/xml)
- ✅ Italy: 2/2 (HTTP 200, Content-Type: text/xml)
- ✅ Poland: 1/1 (HTTP 200, Content-Type: application/rss+xml)

### Trust Weight Rationale

**Why all trust_weight 3 (verified media)?**

- **No official police RSS feeds** available for BE/ES/IT/PL/AT/CH
- **The Local network** (5/7 sources) is verified authoritative media
- **ANSA** (Italian national news agency) is wire service (equivalent to AP/Reuters)
- **Notes From Poland** is established English-language Polish news outlet
- **Brussels Times** is Belgium's largest English-language newspaper

**Evidence upgrade path**: Media sources with 2+ corroborating reports can upgrade to trust_weight 4 (OFFICIAL) via consolidation engine.
