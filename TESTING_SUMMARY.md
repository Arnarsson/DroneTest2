# DroneWatch 2.0 - Testing Summary

**Created**: October 7, 2025
**Status**: Ready for Testing
**Production Site**: https://www.dronemap.cc

---

## 📦 What Was Created

I've created a complete testing suite for DroneWatch 2.0 with three approaches:

### 1. ✅ Manual Test Checklist (`MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`)
- **151 manual test cases** organized by category
- Step-by-step testing instructions
- Expected results for each test
- Pass/fail tracking
- Notes section for observations

**Use When**: You want to manually test the site in your browser

### 2. 🤖 Automated Playwright Tests (`tests/`)
- **32 automated E2E tests**
- Runs across 7 browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari)
- Automatic screenshots on failure
- Video recording of failures
- HTML test reports
- Performance metrics

**Use When**: You want automated testing or CI/CD integration

### 3. 📊 Test Report Template (`TEST_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`)
- Professional test report format
- Sections for all test categories
- Performance metrics tracking
- Issue tracking (P0-P3)
- Sign-off section
- Cross-browser results matrix

**Use When**: You need to document test results formally

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A: Manual Testing

1. Open `MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Go to https://www.dronemap.cc in your browser
3. Follow the checklist step-by-step
4. Check off items as you complete them
5. Document any issues found

**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours for complete manual testing

### Option B: Automated Testing

```bash
# Setup (one-time)
cd tests
./setup.sh

# Run all tests
npm test

# View results
npm run report
```

**Time Estimate**: 10-15 minutes for full automated suite

### Option C: Combined Approach (Recommended)

1. Run automated tests first: `cd tests && npm test`
2. Review automated test results: `npm run report`
3. Use manual checklist for areas that need human validation:
   - Visual design review
   - Content accuracy
   - User experience
   - Accessibility with screen readers

**Time Estimate**: 30-45 minutes total
