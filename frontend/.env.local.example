# API Configuration
# IMPORTANT: For Vercel deployments, set this in Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables
# This must be set at BUILD TIME for Next.js to include it
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://dronewatchv2.vercel.app/api

# For local development:

# Optional: Mapbox for better map tiles

# Upstash Redis Configuration (for distributed rate limiting)
# Required for production deployments to share rate limits across serverless instances
# Get these values from: https://console.upstash.com/
# 1. Create a free account at upstash.com
# 2. Create a new Redis database
# 3. Copy the REST URL and REST Token from the database details page
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-database.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your-upstash-token

# Note: If not configured, the API will fall back to in-memory rate limiting
# which works for local development but is ineffective in serverless environments
